In this weekly challenge I was tasked with assignments for HTML, CSS, and github. In HTML I corrected the Search engine optimization link by creating a id on index.html. For CSS, I commented for each section and reorganized the code to follow the semantic structure. In github, I created a live URl, which can be found below, along with creating a repository for the challenge.

Here is the deployed URl: https://rodrinic017.github.io/Horiseon-challenge/

Github repository URL: https://github.com/rodrinic017/Horiseon-challenge
